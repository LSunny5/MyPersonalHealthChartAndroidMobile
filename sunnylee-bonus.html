		<h5> Download my app <a href="MyPersonalHealthChart.zip">here</a>!</h5>

		<br>
		<p class="textcenter">My Personal Health Chart is your very own personal Medical chart!</p>
		<p class="textcenter2">“When did you last have your TB Booster?  What was the date of your surgery?”</p>
		<p class="tab">	My Personal Health Chart was designed for users like you to help keep track of yours as well as your family and other important individual’s medical information such as medical history, family history, immunizations, medications, allergies, insurance, and other notes.  When you go to visit the doctor or enroll your child at school, various health related questions are asked and you as the healthcare provider is requested to provide the information on the spot.  Instead of having to make up or guess on the dates and times, even the names of surgeries, you can simply open up this app and provide the necessary information to the other healthcare provider.  Perhaps in the future, when you are in need of medical aid and there is no one else around, the healthcare provider can access the information instead of keeping you awake to get information on your medical history.  Data is inputted by the user and easily accessible and readable after you have logged in.  </p>

		<p class="bold">Important note:</p>
		<p class="tab">	Please be kind, this application is still in the process of being made.  There are a lot of features that still have not been implemented.  This is my first mobile Android application and there are a bit of bugs and incompletions.  Time was spent a lot on design, and so functionality is also limited as time constraints limited my ability to fully complete the full functionality of the app.  This was quite a learning experience.  The databases are also not linked together as of yet, and full functionality on many of the pages still needs to be added.  Menu options also need to be added to the menu toolbar as it has not yet been implemented.  Security was also not covered in depth so this app may have some risks and vulnerabilities and I also was not able to clear the app properly.  </p>
